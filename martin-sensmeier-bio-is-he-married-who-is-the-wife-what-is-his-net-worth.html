Seven</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was his role as the lead, Red Harvest in the film, that brought him into the limelight.&nbsp;The actor began his acting career in 2014 when he appeared in the short film,&nbsp;</span><i><span>K’ina Kil: The Slaver’s Son.</span></i><span>&nbsp;Since then, he’s continued to flourish in the American film industry.&nbsp;Although Martin is a newcomer to the industry, he has featured prominently in many thriller films.&nbsp;Besides acting, he is also a model.&nbsp;Join us on an interesting journey through the life of the&nbsp;</span><span>Magnificent Seven</span><span>&nbsp;Star below.&nbsp;Continue reading!</span></p><h2><strong><span>Martin Sensmeier Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>Martin Sensmeier was born on June 27, 1985 in Anchorage, Alaska in the United States.&nbsp;He is American but from Tlingit, Koyukon-Athabasca.&nbsp;His father Raymond Sensmeier is Tlingit while his mother Eva Sensmeier is Koyukon-Athabascan.&nbsp;His parents, who worked for a living, raised him in the small coastal and traditional village of Yakutat, Alaska, where he taught.</span></p><p><span>Martin always dreamed of growing upperformer.&nbsp;He made his own props and costumes and dressed like the characters he had seen in movies.&nbsp;He had his first opportunity to take part in a play in his fourth grade and acted through middle school.&nbsp;During high school, he learned to weld to make ends meet.</span></p><p><span>Before venturing into acting, Martin first worked as a welder while attending a part-time course at the University of Alaska at Anchorage, where he studied for just two years before dropping out.&nbsp;He later got a job at Doyon Oil, a drilling company on the North Slope oil rig.&nbsp;In 2007, while still working on the rig, Martin began taking acting classes in Los Angeles to pursue his acting dreams.&nbsp;He lived in Southern California from where he worked weekdays in the North Slope and went to school in Los Angeles on the weekends.&nbsp;In 2011, he made his final decision to leave the oil fields and permanently relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a full-time acting career.&nbsp;He first started modelling, which he did for a number of years.</span></p><h2><strong><span>acting career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Beginning his acting career, Martin Sensmeier encountered serious difficulties getting roles due to his native background.&nbsp;For a period of about three years, he continued to audition without being selected for a role.&nbsp;What a frustrating experience!&nbsp;However, Martin persevered until 2014 when luck struck him.&nbsp;He landed his first film role in the short film,&nbsp;</span><i><span>K’ina Kil: The Slaver’s Son</span></i><span>&nbsp;where he starred as Tintah.&nbsp;He later got his first feature film role in the science fiction film,&nbsp;</span><span>Encounter</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><span>Martin’s big break came later in 2016 when he starred in a remake of&nbsp;</span><span>The Magnificent Seven</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Martin portrayed the main character “Red Harvest”, one of the seven in the western action film.&nbsp;A Native American warrior and archer preparing for the role of Red Harvest proved to be a very Herculean task for Martin.&nbsp;His daily training for the role included, among other things, a two-hour horseback riding practice, grueling workouts at the gym, and a ridiculously strict diet.&nbsp;However, his hard work was richly rewarded as he appeared alongside Hollywood giants such as Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke.</span><p><span>In 2017, Martin Sensmeier portrayed the character of Chip Hanson in the crime film.&nbsp;</span><span>Wind River</span><span>&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;</span><span>Tree Hill</span><span>&nbsp;star, Kelsey Chow, who starred as his sister, Natalie Hanson.&nbsp;2018 was quite a busy year for Martin as he appeared in four films;&nbsp;</span><span>Perfect</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>Westworld</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond Heaven</span><span>&nbsp;, and&nbsp;</span><span>Guest Rooms</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span>Sensmeier is currently filming as Montford Johnson in the forthcoming biopic,&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Chickasaw Rancher</span></i><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;He would also star alongside Angelina Jolie in the Native American biopic,&nbsp;</span><span>Light Path: The Jim Thorpe Story</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span>Sensmeier is not only an actor, but also a wellness activist.&nbsp;He is the advocate for the Native Wellness Institute and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.&nbsp;He loves playing roles that reflect his ancestors and getting involved in activities that give back to Native American communities.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Martin Sensmeier’s net worth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sensmeier currently has an estimated net worth of US$500,000.&nbsp;Apparently, he makes most of his income from his acting career as he currently has no known businesses or endorsements.&nbsp;Due to his rapidly rising status in the film industry, his net worth has prospects of skyrocketing in the future.</span></p><p><strong><span>See Also: Game of Thrones’ Joe Dempsie Bio, His Girlfriend and Dating

Hodges.&nbsp;Hodges is a Navajo singer and entertainer.&nbsp;She is currently the lead singer with “Dine” Urban Voices, a Navajo singing group from the Phoenix Indian Center.</span></p><p><span>The couple began their love story in 2016 and have been together for over two years.&nbsp;They have since decided to keep their affair to themselves;&nbsp;Neither of them have spoken to the media about their relationship.&nbsp;You only get to know them through Instagram, where they often share photos of their beautiful moments.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p
