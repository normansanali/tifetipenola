On the scorecards of all three judges, Charlo was the clear winner after every round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/29080643/JermallCharlo_6-1024x576.jpg><p>Several times during the battle, the fight appeared to be over, but Finney was able to force Charlo to the limit for the sixth time in his career.</p><p>The IBF mandated that Cornelius Bundrage, 42, defend his title against Charlo in May 2015 (34-5, 19 KOs). Initially, July 25 was mentioned as a possible date.</p><p>Several days before the fight, on June 8, Bundrage was forced to withdraw due to an injury above his left eye.

There were no current champions in the light middleweight division, which Charlo had hoped to unify.</p><p>On June 5, 2017, rumors of Jorge Sebastian Heiland, a WBC mandatory challenger (28-4-2, 15 KOs), being forced to face Charlo in a championship eliminator spread around Argentina.</p><p>The WBC confirmed on November 21 that Charlo would face Hugo Centeno (26-1, 14 KOs), for the opportunity to win the interim middleweight championship.</p><p>A doubleheader at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 2018, was confirmed by Premier Boxing Champions in October 2018.</p><p>Brandon Adams, a middleweight who was ranked #12 by the WBC, squared up against Charlo on June 29, 2019. Adams stepped out of the box and at times proved challenging for Charlo.</p><p>Nevertheless, Charlo was able to control the majority of the battle and prevail by a resounding unanimous decision. Two of the judges gave Charlo a score of 120-108, while one gave the champion a score of 119-109.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/29080626/jermall-charlo-1024x652.jpg><p>Dennis Hogan was the opponent for Charlo’s WBC middleweight title defense on December 7, 2019. At middleweight, Hogan was ranked #5 by the WBC.</p><p>On September 26, 2020, Charlo faced middleweight contender Sergiy Derevyanchenko, who is ranked first by the WBC and fourth by The Ring.</p><p>Charlo used a strong jab, displayed a strong chin, and a variety of shots to outpoint Derevyanchenko to a unanimous decision win, with scores of 116-112, 117-111, and 118-110, and retain his WBC crown. This opponent was likely his hardest opponent to date.</p><p>On June 19, 2021, Charlo defeated unknown challenger Juan Macias Montiel to successfully defend his championship for the fourth time. With scores of 118-109, 119-109, and 120-108, Charlo won the bout on a unanimous decision due to his dominance throughout.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Jermall Charlo worth?</h2><p>Jermall Charlo has a net worth estimated to be about $3 million.
