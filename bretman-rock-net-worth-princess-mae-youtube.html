People’s Choice Beauty Influencer of the Year in 2019. Walking alongside the hottest celebrities, musicians, and personalities, Bretman owned the red carpet. He effortlessly slayed the red carpet, serving looks left and right. Shocked over the win, Bretman took to Instagram to thank everyone who voted for him.</p><p>The Philippine-born beauty influencer based in Hawaii reached popularity several years ago for his sense of humor, beauty tips, and the sibling dynamic he shares with his sister Princess Mae.</p><p>In 2017, and at just 19 years old, Bretman was recognized as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the 30 most influential teens by Time Magazine</a>. But the glamour of the Hollywood carpet did not overshadow what was really on Bretman’s mind and in his heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bretman-and-princess-s-father-passed-away>Bretman and Princess’s Father Passed Away</h2><p>Before the People’s Choice Awards, Bretman lost his father, who passed away in the Philippines.

The charismatic YouTuber told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Balitang America</a>, “my dad really understood me at such a young age and really supported me literally before I could even walk, and he told me that he always knew that I was gay. I remember when I was turning four, they got me this big truck, and inside were barbies.”</p><p>With the night’s big win, there was no doubt who Bretman wanted to dedicate his most significant achievement to: “I would really like to dedicate it to the parents out there who love and support their children unconditionally,” he added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bretman-s-net-worth>Bretman’s Net Worth</h2><p>The media personality has over 15 million followers on Instagram and almost 8 million subscribers on YouTube. Bretman has an estimated net worth of 1.3 million dollars. The beauty guru also makes extra income from sponsored Instagram posts.

They made many pretty popular videos together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Princess is a single teen mom who inspires many young girls. She often includes her daughter in the videos she publishes with Bretman. After Cleo was born, she found herself a new boyfriend named Chris. They created a new YouTube channel together, which is called LovingUs Family.</p><h2 id=lovingus-family-youtube-channel>LovingUs Family YouTube Channel</h2><p>Chris suddenly was very active on social media platforms. He even was on Bretman’s channel a couple of times, although everyone didn’t like him. Many people thought that Chris was a “clout chaser” and used Bretman and Princess for popularity.</p><p>At one point, Princess confessed via DM that she had to cut ties with her YouTube family channel with Chris completely. They had their first baby together; his name is Ezékiel. There has been a lot of rumors about their break up saying he cheated on her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Ariana Grande Really Do Her Own Makeup?</a></span></p><p>Princess then confirmed their breakup. She wrote on her Instagram, “I definitely did everything that I could to keep my family together and kept everyone else happy.

He seems to care about his art, family, and fans genuinely. When people talk about him is to spread positivity and happiness by sharing his funny videos. Some polemic has surrounded Princess Mae, but she remains strong despite becoming a mom at such a young age and losing her father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The siblings are now closer than ever.
