While the gore might be a bit much for some viewers, the streaming platform just dropped their newest feel-good sitcom, Pretty Smart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series follows the life of Chelsea, played by none other than <a href=#>Emily Osment</a>, who found herself heartbroken and moving in with her charismatic sister and her three roommates in sunny Los Angeles. The show, spanning 10 episodes, has certainly become a hit amongst fans, and we certainly don't blame 'em.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Emily Osment And Miley Cyrus' Relationship</a></span></p><p>Emily Osment plays alongside love interest, <a href=#>Gregg Sulkin</a>, who much like Osment, made his debut on Disney. Considering viewers have recognized a few familiar faces on the hit series, who is the rest of the cast? And what have they appeared in prior to Pretty Smart?</p><h2 id=emily-osment><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Emily Osment</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emily Osment is certainly the biggest name attached to the hit Netflix series, considering the actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been in the game for quite some time now</a>. Emily gained worldwide recognition playing the role of Lily (and Lola) in the popular Disney series, Hannah Montana, alongside Miley Cyrus, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Jason Earles.</p><p>Osment is also the younger sister to Sixth Sense actor, Haley Joel Osment. Prior to playing Chelsea in Pretty Smart, Emily has also appeared in Spy Kids 2: The Island Of Lost Drama, and Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. In addition to acting, Emily has also dabbled with singing throughout her career, having her music be featured on an array of Disney shows.</p><h2 id=olivia-macklin><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Olivia Macklin</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Olivia Macklin plays the role of Claire in Pretty Smart, and while her acting is obviously up to par, the Netflix series marks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of Olivia's very first major acting gigs.</a></p><p>Olivia had secured a number of small roles prior to playing Emily Osment's on-screen younger sis, some of which include recurring roles in Filthy Rich and La To Vegas. Olivia also appeared in the period film, Radium Girls, however, after her time with Netflix, we're certain we'll be seeing her pop up a lot more now.</p><h2 id=michael-hsu-rosen><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Michael Hsu Rosen</span></h2><p>Michael Hsu Rosen portrays the hilarious on-screen influencer, Jayden, in Pretty Smart. Prior to the series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael appeared in a handful of TV and film projects</a> including his recurring role in Tiny Pretty Things, and his guest appearance on The Good Doctor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Fans Really Think About Netflix's Season 3 Of 'You'</a></span></p><p>As if the acting weren't enough, Rosen is also a man of many talents, having a background in professional dance and singing. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, Michael wished to pursue the arts so much that he dropped out of Yale "in order to pursue the stage," and while it was a risky move, it certainly paid off.</p><h2 id=gregg-sulkin><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Gregg Sulkin</span></h2><p>Much like his co-star, Emily Osment, Gregg Sulkin also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got his big break on Disney</a>. Sulkin appeared alongside Brenda Song on Pass The Plate before securing a full-time role on the third and fourth season of Wizards of Waverly Place, where Gregg played Mason Greyback, Selena Gomez' on-screen love interest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gregg later moved on to Pretty Little Liars and Runaways before landing his role on Pretty Smart, where he plays none other than fitness trainer and gym owner, Grant. While Gregg is British in real life, the actor has done a pretty stellar job at putting on an American accent for the series, leading many fans to believe he was actually from the United States to begin with. Talk about good acting!</p><h2 id=cinthya-carmona><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cinthya Carmona</span></h2><p>Cinthya Carmona has gained prominence since appearing in Pretty Smart playing the role of Solana. The former lawyer turn spiritual guide became a fan-favorite character, proving herself to be quite the actress.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Don't Look Up': Everything The Cast Has Said About The Netflix Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to her time with Netflix, Carmona <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared in a handful of television projects</a>, including East Los High and Greenhouse Academy, but it's clear Pretty Smart stands out as her biggest role to date. However, we know it's only the beggining for Cinthya from here on out.</p><h2 id=geoff-ross><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Geoff Ross</span></h2><p>Geoff Ross plays the role of Howard in Pretty Smart, Claire's boss, and comedic relief at the local caf√©. While he began acting back in 2008, Ross <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't fully pursure the art until a decade later.</a></p><p>In 2018, he landed a small role in a CollegeHumor Originals all while snagging a recurring role in Anime Crimes Division. After landing spots on Reno 911!, Pet Friendly, and of course, Netflix'sYou, which is currenlty airing its third season, Geoff made his way over to his biggest role yet in Pretty Smart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-miles><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kevin Miles</span></h2><p>Kevin Miles may not be a permanent character on the Netflix series, however, he's still a standout star. Kevin portrayed the role of David, who appears in three episodes throughout the series.</p><p>While many fans will recognize him from Pretty Smart, he's often recognized for playing the role of none other than Jake from State Farm! Yes, you read that right, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Miles took on the role of Jake from State Farm</a> back in 2017. The actor has also appeared in countless other projects including Underdogs, Emanuel And Me, and Miles Away, to name a few.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Some Fans Aren't Happy With 'Seinfeld' Being On Netflix, Here's Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddqbWmec%2BrnK2sqWLArq3RrWScmaOperit0maZnp6fp7JuwMeeoKtlnprBp7jIsWSsrZOYsrS%2FjJ6koqSpYry0ucSnq2afopq0qHnSrqOkoZ5k</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-the-pretty-smart-cast-was-before-their-netflix-success-emily-osment-gregg-sulkin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-the-pretty-smart-cast-was-before-their-netflix-success-emily-osment-gregg-sulkin.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-the-pretty-smart-cast-was-before-their-netflix-success-emily-osment-gregg-sulkin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-the-pretty-smart-cast-was-before-their-netflix-success-emily-osment-gregg-sulkin.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-the-pretty-smart-cast-was-before-their-netflix-success-emily-osment-gregg-sulkin.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-the-pretty-smart-cast-was-before-their-netflix-success-emily-osment-gregg-sulkin.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yerin-ha.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yerin-ha.html>Yerin Ha Wiki, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Parents &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wecrashed-apple-tv-real-story-adam-neumann.html>WeCrashed: The shocking true story behind Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway's new series</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wecrashed-apple-tv-real-story-adam-neumann.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
