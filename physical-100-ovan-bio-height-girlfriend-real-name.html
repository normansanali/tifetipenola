But it wasn’t just the title of “most perfect physique” the participants were fighting for, 300 million won (approx USD 243 thousand) was also on the line!</span></p><p><span>“Fight to the death. Survive to the end.” These were the words that appeared in the show’s trailer. Hinting that the contestants competed to survive purely with their physical strength.</span></p><p><span>In the first ep, OVAN and others were placed in a massive space where plaster casts of their torsos sat on marble pedestals, arranged in concentric circles around a fountain. They then walked around, admiring each other’s plaster/actual bodies, objectifying and judging each other.</span></p><p><span>The show also radiated Squid Game vibes as assistants and safety personnel wore gray jumpsuits with most of their faces covered.</span></p><p><span>So, for the first challenge, the contestants were asked to hang on to a suspended apparatus lifted in the air. Through this, the participants quickly realized that the show was not only a test of brute strength but also endurance and mental strength.</span></p><p><span>Later, based on how long they lasted, the players were then placed in order from 100 to 1, and in order, they got to choose who they’ll face in the first quest — a&nbsp; fight over a ball.</span></p><p><span>Overall, 50 matches took place in the same two arenas, just like </span><i><span>The Challenge</span></i><span>.
