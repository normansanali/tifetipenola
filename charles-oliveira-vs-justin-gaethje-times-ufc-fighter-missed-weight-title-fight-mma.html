Most recently at UFC 274, Charles Oliveira missed weight for his lightweight bout with Justin Gaethje. However, the Brazilian isn't alone in history as losing the battle to the scale prior to a fight for gold.</p><h2 id=matt-hughes-vs-joe-riggs-ufc-56><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Matt Hughes vs. Joe Riggs (UFC 56)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Joe-Riggs-UFC-186.jpg><p>When Matt Hughes ended his career, he had a total of seven title defenses across two UFC welterweight title reigns. What is forgotten is that the Hall of Famer should've had an additional title defense on the books. That being his victory over Joe Riggs at UFC 56.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was the first time in UFC history that a fighter missed weight for a title bout. Riggs missed weight by 2.5 pounds, but the bout was allowed to go ahead as a non-title affair. After losing to the scale, Riggs went on to lose to Hughes via first-round submission.</p><h2 id=anderson-silva-vs-travis-lutter-ufc-67><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Anderson Silva vs. Travis Lutter (UFC 67)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Travis-Lutter-1.jpg><p>Matt Serra made history on The Ultimate Fighter season four. After winning the welterweight tournament, he went on to shock the world with a first-round <a href=#>knockout of Georges St-Pierre</a>.

After defeating Charles Oliveira, he was given an interim title fight with Max Holloway at UFC 206. Sadly for Showtime, the title fight went ahead as one for only Holloway, as he missed weight by three pounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The interim title fight was <a href=#>dominated by Holloway</a>. After Pettis's hand broke early in the fight, his night went from bad to worse. The headlining bout was won by Holloway in the third round, after a devastating combination. The victory was the first title win of the wild career of Blessed.</p><h2 id=yoel-romero-vs-luke-rockhold-ufc-221><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Yoel Romero vs. Luke Rockhold (UFC 221)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Yoel-Romero-UFC-248-.jpg><p>Luke Rockhold was scheduled to face Robert Whittaker for the undisputed middleweight title at UFC 221. However, when the champion pulled out on three weeks' notice, the bout was turned into an interim championship bout. Stepping in on short notice was Yoel Romero, who was fresh off a loss to Whittaker.</p><p>Romero's short notice likely played a role as he badly missed weight. The Cuban missed weight by 2.7 pounds but was able to turn around his fortunes on fight day. After going down two rounds, Romero blasted Rockhold out in the third round to secure a huge win.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-whittaker-vs-yoel-romero-ufc-225><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Robert Whittaker vs. Yoel Romero (UFC 225)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Whittaker-Romero-UFC-213.jpg><p>Yoel Romero is the only fighter to ever miss weight for a UFC title bout on two different occasions. Months after he missed weight for his interim title bout with Rockhold, he earned a shot at the <a href=#>undisputed champion Robert Whittaker</a>. The bout was a rematch of their wild UFC 213 matchup, where Whittaker won by unanimous decision.</p><p>Romero missed weight by 0.2 pounds prior to the bout.

Oliveira knocked down Gaethje in the first and wound up submitting him via rear-naked choke.
