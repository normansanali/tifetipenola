Bailey was excited by the inscription of the president’s name, but the watch had come without any documents — so his first step was to try and verify that President Theodore Roosevelt had actually once owned it.</p><p>He reached out to two museums associated with Theodore Roosevelt: Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, the site of Roosevelt’s former home, and the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site, where Roosevelt took the oath of office following the assassination of William McKinley. Both confirmed that the watch appeared to be authentic.</p><p>Then, shortly before putting the watch up for auction in 2023, Bailey was visited by several people who he thought were prospective buyers. Instead, reports the <a href=# rel=noopener>Associated Press</a>, they were FBI agents.</p><p>The National Park Service (NPS) — which oversees both Roosevelt sites — and the FBI had been looking for the watch since it was stolen. After recovering it from Bailey, they returned it to Sagamore Hill.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-497720 alt="Theodore Roosevelt Watch Face" width=716 height=610 data-sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/theodore-roosevelt-watch-face.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-497720 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Jason Wickersty, National Park Service</span><span class=caption-body>The watch had been missing for more than three decades when it turned up in Florida.</span></p><p>“This was feel-good news,” Tweed Roosevelt, the president’s 82-year-old great-grandson,&nbsp;remarked to the Associated Press. “For me, it kind of felt like almost as if a piece of TR’s spirit being returned to Sagamore Hill, like a little bit of him was coming back. And so I felt that was really cool.”</p><p>Indeed, the watch, though inexpensive, was important to Roosevelt.</p><p>“As it turns out, this isn’t just any old pocket watch,” Tweed Roosevelt explained. “It was a watch that TR placed great sentimental value on.”</p><h2>The Story Of Theodore Roosevelt’s Watch</h2><p>“This watch was a fairly pedestrian Waltham 17 jewel watch with an inexpensive coin silver case,” Special Agent Robert Giczy, a member of the FBI Art Crime Team, explained in <a href=# rel=noopener>an FBI press release</a> about the watch. “It’s a ‘Riverside’ grade and model ‘1888’ with a hunter-style case, meaning it has a lid on either side which fold and encase the dial and the movement.”</p><p>But though the watch was not valuable, it held great value to Roosevelt. It was a gift to him from his sister, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, and her husband, Douglas Robinson Jr. They gave the watch to Roosevelt just before he sailed to Cuba in 1898 to fight in the Spanish-American War.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-497725 alt="Roosevelt In The Spanish American War" width=700 height=880 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/theodore-roosevelt-spanish-american-war.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-497725 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Theodore Roosevelt Collection, Houghton Library, Harvard University</span><span class=caption-body>Theodore Roosevelt in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. His bravery during the conflict made him an American hero.</span></p><p>“Darling Corinne, You could not have given me a more useful present than the watch,” Roosevelt wrote in May 1898. “It was exactly what I wished… Thank old Douglas for the watch — and for his many, many kindnesses.”</p><p>Not only did Roosevelt carry the watch with him in Cuba, but historians also believe that he had it with him during his voyages to Africa and the Amazon.</p><p>“The stories this watch could tell over the last 126 years include colorful and profound moments in American history,” Superintendent Jonathan Parker of Sagamore Hill National Historic Site <a href=# rel=noopener>said in a statement</a>.</p><p>“Historic objects are powerful because they are literal participants in historic events, and in the case of this storied watch, it is also a beloved family heirloom of a renowned American president. Almost 40 years have passed since the public had last seen President Roosevelt’s watch and we’re excited to place this watch back into the light on public display.”</p><p>After reading about the recovery of Theodore Roosevelt’s pocket watch more than three decades after it was stolen, look through these <a href=#>fascinating facts about every U.S. president</a>.
