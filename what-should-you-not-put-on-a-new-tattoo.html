Remove the bandage after 24 hours. Gently wash the tattoo with antimicrobial soap and water and be sure to pat dry. Apply a layer of antibacterial/Vaseline ointment twice a day, but don't put on another bandage.<h2>Is it OK to put Vaseline on a tattoo?</h2>Vaseline isn't the best choice for tattoo aftercare.
