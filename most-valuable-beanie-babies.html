(You may even have a few of your own.) The colorful, plush stuffed animals were introduced in the early 1990s and quickly became a hot collector’s item.</p><p>HBO Max’s upcoming documentary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beanie Mania</a> follows the story of Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner and his extremely lucrative business. As he revealed in the documentary's trailer, his company Ty Inc. made $2.6 million from Beanie Babies alone in 1996.</p><p>Pretty wild, right? Well, get this: The following year, that number grew to $23 million. How, exactly? Well, Beanie enthusiasts were (and still are) willing to break the bank to get their hands on certain versions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @beanie_brobie</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fun fact: Beanies with imperfections are worth more.</h2><p>While Beanie Babies were only sold for a few dollars back in the day, certain models became more valuable once they were retired. This was especially true for the Beanies Babies that may have had imperfections or were flawed in production.</p><p>Let me explain: While customers typically prefer items sans impurities, Beanie collectors wanted just the opposite. They desired misfit Beanie Babies that may have boasted an extra whisker or had a spelling error on its tag. To them, these flaws made the plush toys much more unique.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: eBay</a><p>Beanie Babies with tag errors and imperfections are usually listed at much higher prices.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Warning: The same Beanie Baby may be available on eBay for both $1 and $10,000.</h2><p>Unfortunately, there's no real consensus regarding the values of Beanie Babies. <strong>Some sellers will charge a few bucks for the same exact Beanie Baby that's being sold for thousands of dollars elsewhere. </strong>Bottom line: It's brutal out there and nothing makes sense.</p><p>We took a gander on eBay to see which Beanies are being sold for the big bucks (and also, simultaneously, little bucks).

His fabric is always green with brown and yellow hues. Any other colors indicate a counterfeit."</p><p>Steg is currently going for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$50,000 on eBay</a> While there are much <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheaper versions of Steg available</a>, it's hard to tell if they're legitimate models or are knockoffs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 🎀Jessica Cederholm🦄 (@beaniebubies)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @beaniebubies</a></figure><p>For more things related to Beanie Babies, catch the HBO Max documentary Beanie Mania when it premieres on Dec. 23, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfory0wIyvmKWtkZe5pnnBnpinoZVir6KuyJ6q</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmost-valuable-beanie-babies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmost-valuable-beanie-babies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmost-valuable-beanie-babies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmost-valuable-beanie-babies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmost-valuable-beanie-babies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmost-valuable-beanie-babies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./acacia-kersey-divorce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./acacia-kersey-divorce.html>Acacia Kersey And Her Husband Jairus Kersey Are Separated!!
