"So happy for the two of you."</p><p class=Fg>On January 2, 2023, Ruby posted a video of the moment she learned she and Kalick were having a baby boy. Her father disclosed the sex of the unborn child by reading it from a sealed piece of paper.</p><p class=Fg>"It's a boy," the elated future grandfather <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.people.com/parents/rod-stewart-announces-second-grandchild-party-its-a-boy/>proclaimed</a> as cheers erupted. Meanwhile, Ruby hugged Kalick, and Rod began singing "another winkle in the Stewart family."</p><p class=Fg>The family patriarch received praise from a fan on Instagram, who <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CnKX9imjtMO/>penned</a>: "I love how Rod is such a caring, loving family man to all his children."</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Rod Is Close to His 8 Children & Shows the Importance of Family</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Rod may regret not spending enough time with his older kids as they grew up, but he has found a way to compensate for lost time.</p><p class=Fg>In August 2022, the doting dad reunited with his eight children on a family getaway to Italy. He was joined by his current wife, actress Penny Lancaster - who <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rod-stewart-poses-eight-children-27760024>said</a> her heart was "ready to burst" after the family finally came together.</p><p class=Fg>Along with the brood, Lancaster and Rod went on holiday aboard a yacht on the Amalfi coast. He shared pictures from the family trip on his Instagram Stories.</p><p class=Fg>The first image was of Rod's sons, Sean, Liam, Alastair, and Aiden, and he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rod-stewart-poses-eight-children-27760024>captioned</a> the post: "My boys." The "Young Turks" singer also shared photos of his daughters, Kimberly, Ruby, and Renee, and wrote: "With my girls."</p><p class=Fg>Ruby expressed gratitude for the time spent with her family and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rod-stewart-poses-eight-children-27760024>said</a> she went home fulfilled. "I left Italy with my heart as full as my belly. Our last family vacation was in 2015, so this one was well overdue."</p><p class=Fg>She explained that because everyone lives in different locations, it is difficult to get together often to celebrate one another's "milestones." The California native thanked her stepmom Lancaster for bringing everyone together.</p><p class=Fg>The fashion model said the trip was more than just a vacation; it created a bonding experience with her loved ones. "We laughed, we cried, caught up on lost time, we sang and danced, even suffered from a few water sports injuries," she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rod-stewart-poses-eight-children-27760024>revealed</a>.</p><p class=Fg>Ruby expressed she was fortunate to have such a loving family while noting she would be lost without them. "Love you guys," she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rod-stewart-poses-eight-children-27760024>penned</a> before adding: "Thank you, dad, for reminding us of the importance of family, and Thank you Penny, for always bringing us together again."</p><p class=Fg>Lancaster, who shares sons Aiden and Alastair with Rod, warmly <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rod-stewart-poses-eight-children-27760024>replied</a> to her stepdaughter's post: "I'm shedding a few tears but happy ones with a heart ready to burst XX."</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Rod Does Not Give His Children Money Because of His Wife</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Lancaster is her husband's "moral compass" regarding the kids. Rod <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.people.com/parents/rod-stewart-giving-money-to-kids-during-bets-exclusive/>revealed</a> in November 2021 how he parented his offspring in terms of finances and shared he listens to his wife, whom he wed in 2007.</p><p class=Fg>The Grammy Award-winning musician disclosed the mom of two always cautions him about giving the children way too much money than they need.</p><p class=Fg>He <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.people.com/parents/rod-stewart-giving-money-to-kids-during-bets-exclusive/>stated</a> that it is a "fine line" when it comes to giving his sons and daughters the dollar as he refrains from giving them "thousands and millions" but shares "a little bit." Rod has heeded his spouse's advice in this department:</p><p class=Fg>"I go to my moral compass, and I ask my wife. She won't let me give them a $100 bill."</p><p class=Fg>Rod <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.people.com/parents/rod-stewart-giving-money-to-kids-during-bets-exclusive/>explained</a> whenever he and his brood have a "game on a football pitch," he would bet on them and challenge them to score from a specific spot on the field.</p><p class=Fg>"The halfway line. We call it crossbar. You got to kick the ball in it at the bar top. And I was like, 'The first one to get three gets $100.' [My wife] comes out, she says, 'What are you doing? $100? Make it five,'" he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.people.com/parents/rod-stewart-giving-money-to-kids-during-bets-exclusive/>recounted</a>.</p><p class=Fg>That said, Rod aims to teach his children the "hard way" about financial literacy and avoids spoiling them.

"You have to treat all of them as individuals with individual problems," he said.</p><p class=Fg>When asked about the key to his happy marriage with Lancaster, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Rod</a> shared that he and Lancaster have a lot of intimacy, including kissing and hugging each other frequently throughout their days together.</p><p class=Fg>"I couldn't have asked for anything better.
