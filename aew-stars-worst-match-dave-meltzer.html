Whilst the feud between Baker and Bea Priestly was decent, <a href=#>their chemistry in the ring never clicked.</a></p><p>This was a sloppy match on the Buy-In show for Full Gear 2019, and it marked one of Priestley’s last appearances with the company.

It lasted under 5 minutes with Bradshaw standing tall.</p><h2 id=mjf-vs-matt-cross-all-in-2018-2-75-stars><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>MJF: Vs Matt Cross, All In 2018 (2.75 Stars)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MJF-vs-Matt-Cross-All-In.jpg><p>MJF is still very young, but has had countless great matches already, though he hasn’t had a lot of matches rated just yet. One of his first forays into the wider view of the professional wrestling world <a href=#>came at the All In PPV </a>during a match with Matt Cross.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a decent match though nothing overly special, with the main talking points coming from MJF’s character and promo work rather than the in-ring action itself.</p><h2 id=thunder-rosa-battle-royal-the-wrdl-on-gcw-2022-0-5-stars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Thunder Rosa: Battle Royal, The WRDL On GCW 2022 (0.5 Stars)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-WRLD-On-GCW-Battle-Royal.jpg><p>This match took place on the pre-show <a href=#>for this historic GCW event at the Hammerstein Ballroom</a>, but this battle royal was a complete mess, and not in a chaotic and fun way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kenny Omega's 10 Best Matches, According To Dave Meltzer</a></span></p><p>Everything that happened felt random, with no rhyme or reason behind the timing of entrances into the match, with the in-ring work being incredibly sloppy too.

At Fastlane, he battled Bad News Barrett for the Intercontinental Championship.</p><p>The match itself was quite solid, but it ended with a truly frustrating disqualification finish which left fans both in the arena and at home groaning in despair.</p><h2 id=chris-jericho-vs-great-khali-raw-2010-0-stars><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Jericho: Vs Great Khali, Raw 2010 (0 Stars)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Great-Khali-vs-Chris-Jericho-WWE-Raw.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst there wasn’t anything overly wrong with this match, there was barely anything right either. Jericho targeted Khali’s leg until he found a chance to lock in the Walls of Jericho for quite a fast submission victory.</p><p>However, Khali is renowned for being one of the worst workers of all time, and his lack of selling ability might be why this match is rated so low. Jericho did the best he could, but only a select few have worked miracles with Khali.</p><h2 id=darby-allin-casino-battle-royal-all-out-2020-2-5-stars><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Darby Allin: Casino Battle Royal, All Out 2020 (2.5 Stars)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/All-Out-Casino-Battle-Royale-2020.jpg><p><a href=#>Darby Allin is one of the hottest stars in professional wrestling,</a> and thus far his career hasn’t been overly long, so there is plenty more time for him to receive lower ratings.

Prior to the match, Rhodes (Goldust at the time) was injured, meaning that he couldn’t wrestle. He spent over 5 minutes stalling outside the ring, with Warrior doing some “comedy” spots such as smoking a cigar and trying to coax the Intercontinental Champion into the ring.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Claudio Castagnoli’s 10 Best Matches, According To Dave Meltzer</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Rhodes got into the ring, he was sent back to the outside, before being counted out. However, there was no explanation as to why he wasn’t counted out in the five minutes prior to this. It was a weird, baffling match which was awful to sit through.</p><h2 id=bryan-danielson-vs-sheamus-wrestlemania-28-0-stars><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bryan Danielson: Vs Sheamus, WrestleMania 28 (0 Stars)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bryan-danielson-vs-sheamus-wrestlemania.jpg><p>This was an infamously controversial match from WrestleMania 28. After being robbed of their spot on the show the year prior, the former Daniel Bryan and Sheamus had their chance to put on a great match for the World Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>However, it ended in 18 seconds with Sheamus hitting one move and winning, in what was a hugely shocking outcome. For Bryan, one of the best wrestlers in the world, this felt like a complete slap in the face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeRmsRuv9Oaqaxlp6S%2FtMCMppitm5hisaLCxGaknqSkr7Kzew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faew-stars-worst-match-dave-meltzer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faew-stars-worst-match-dave-meltzer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faew-stars-worst-match-dave-meltzer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faew-stars-worst-match-dave-meltzer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faew-stars-worst-match-dave-meltzer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faew-stars-worst-match-dave-meltzer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./david-arquette.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./david-arquette.html>David Arquette -Bio, Age, Net Worth, Career, Height, Married, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-evantubehd-girlfriend-age-height-and-real-name-429171-html.html>Who Is EvanTubeHD Girlfriend?
