<time>02 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>America is a melting pot of cultures from around the world, and Hollywood is the best representation of this diversity. Concentrating on a specific set of people will result in the narrative becoming stifled. This is avoided by selecting a wide range of topics. Because there is so much to tell about African-Americans, filmmakers have a wide range of options. It is also their job to tell these stories since films are supposed to be reflections of society, and if they become biased, how can we expect society to improve? With that in mind, here’s a list of really good African American movies on Hulu that are now accessible to stream:</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Black Cop (2017)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Boomerang (1992)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Check It (2016)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Fences (2016)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> He Got Game (1998)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> If Beale Street Could Talk (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Kassim the Dream (2009)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Monsters and Men (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Paid in Full (2002)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Precious (2009)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> Sorry to Bother You (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> Tyrel (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> Undisputed (2002)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">14</span> Where Hands Touch (2018)</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Black_Cop_2017>Black Cop (2017)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Black-Cop.jpg alt width=1024 height=592 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>It can be difficult to let go of something that has been inside you for a long time. Many people still hold onto bigotry and prejudice because they find it difficult to let go of the racial superiority they’ve been told they have. It is considerably more difficult for a person of color to change these people’s minds about them. No matter how excellent a person you are or how skilled at your profession you are, someone or something, large or tiny, will always hit you this way. ‘Black Cop’ is about one of these characters. He is a black cop who has committed to defend everyone in his neighborhood. When members of his own unit begin to treat him badly, he is compelled to reconsider his position.</p><h3><span id=Boomerang_1992>Boomerang (1992)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boomerang-1.jpg alt width=884 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>If someone says to you, “what goes around, comes around,” don’t take it lightly. Karma is like a Lannister in that she will always pay her obligations. So, if you’ve been behaving badly and treating the majority of people around you terribly, now is the moment to reconsider your actions. Eddie Murphy’s character Marcus Graham can teach you a thing or two. He has a thriving profession and an extraordinary capacity to seduce every lady in his path. He’s a total tomboy. Despite having several affairs, he has yet to find the right woman for him. It’s not that he couldn’t connect with these women or that they treated him badly. It’s just that his definition of perfection in a woman is based on a set of criteria. The issue arises when he finally meets “the one,” only to discover that she is a female counterpart of himself.</p><h3><span id=Check_It_2016>Check It (2016)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Check-It.jpg alt width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>It’s not really a movie, but it’s a documentary with a lot of meaning. The LGBT+ community has been through a lot, and they are still going through it. Some “regular” people treat them horribly, and you can only imagine how bad it is if you ask someone who isn’t straight. Catcalling is only the beginning of the problem. People who are more dangerous escalate it to physical assault, which can result in serious injury, if not death. Imagine being gay and black at the same time! In such a situation, where would one go to seek assistance? The gay and transgender community in Washington, D.C. concluded that being in numbers was the best way to feel safe. ‘Check It’ relates the narrative of how they started their own gang.</p><h3><span id=Fences_2016>Fences (2016)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fences.jpg alt width=1024 height=575 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>When it comes to their children’s destiny, parents are possibly the most important aspect. They frequently unload the burden of their failed goals on their children, forcing them to achieve what they themselves could not. Then there are those who are so discouraged by their own failures that they believe their children will never be able to match them. One such man is the subject of the film ‘Fences.’ Troy Maxson is played by Denzel Washington. He went through some difficult moments as a child. He was good at baseball, but there were no black players at the time, and he was a victim of racial prejudice. Years later, when his kid has the opportunity to play baseball, he refuses to give him the opportunity.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u8b21a10ceaff596a7dc5666eab9877b3><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Journey Through Time: Historical Movies on Netflix You Can't Miss</span></a><h3><span id=He_Got_Game_1998>He Got Game (1998)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/He-Got-Game.jpg alt width=1024 height=538 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘He Got Game,’ directed by Spike Lee, tells the story of a parent whose future in jail is determined by his son’s professional choice. Jake Shuttlesworth is played by Denzel Washington, and his son, Jesus, is played by Ray Allen, a former basketball player. Jesus had a natural flair for the game, which he inherited from his father, Jake, who had spent his childhood years intensively training his son. However, one blunder led to the end of both of their lives. Jake was convicted of murdering his wife and condemned to prison. He gets a call six years later from the governor, who wants Jesus to join his team. Jake’s reward is that if he can persuade his kid to do so, he will be released early. He is given a week’s probation, but will their relationship be mended in that time?</p><h3><span id=If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk_2018>If Beale Street Could Talk (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/If-Beale-Street-Could-Talk.jpg alt width=1000 height=562 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘If Beale Street Could Talk,’ based on James Baldwin’s novel of the same name, chronicles a woman’s attempt to prove the innocence of the man she loves. Tish and Fonny are played by Kiki Layne and Stephan James, respectively. Tish begins on a trip to clear Fonny’s record when he is jailed for raping a lady, a crime he could not have committed because he was never there in the first place. Despite his convincing alibi, law enforcement appears hesitant to let him leave. How long will she have to wait for justice? Would it have been less difficult if they had been white?</p><h3><span id=Kassim_the_Dream_2009>Kassim the Dream (2009)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kassim-the-Dream.jpg alt width=1024 height=662 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>No matter how horrible things are in your life, you can always rise above them and achieve amazing things. The audience learns a similar lesson from Kassim Ouma’s experience. Kassim’s life in Uganda was nothing short of a nightmare before he became the World Boxing Champion. At the tender age of six, he was compelled to join the army after a rifle was placed in his hands while he was meant to be playing with his buddies. The power struggle between the rebels and the government resulted in some horrific acts against and by young soldiers, and Kassim’s ordeal is unthinkable. He sought a way out by joining the army’s boxing team. After all of his hard work, training, and sacrifice, he is now one of the best in the world.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ucf1b88a73f7d6d40ef4b6670580afb7e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>16 Best Miniseries You Can Watch On Hulu - For Those You Can't Commit To Long Series</span></a><h3><span id=Monsters_and_Men_2018>Monsters and Men (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Monsters-and-Men.jpg alt width=1024 height=538 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Police brutality against African-Americans is not uncommon. Many instances gained national prominence when some young people were killed in the process, and the public took to the streets to protest the unfairness and demand that everyone be treated equally. ‘Monsters and Individuals’ takes advantage of this setting to follow the experiences of three men at various phases of their lives as they contemplate how the system treats them and how they should respond. It starts with a young man witnessing the killing of another black teenager at the hands of a police officer. He records it on camera, but is concerned about the impact it will have on his life if he chooses to make it public. Another character is a black police officer who has witnessed his fellow cops’ neutrality towards his people. His powerlessness consumes him. The third character is a young baseball player with a bright future. But it might be jeopardized if he joins the demonstration, which his conscience is continuously urging him to do.</p><h3><span id=Paid_in_Full_2002>Paid in Full (2002)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Paid-in-Full.jpg alt width=1400 height=700 sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>According to Dumbledore, the choice between what’s simple and what’s right is the most difficult of all! People, particularly young people, find it difficult to resist the lure of the incorrect road. When your buddies join you on that journey, it becomes much simpler. Ace’s buddies were drug dealers who made a lot of money. He, on the other hand, was stuck with whatever his dry-cleaning job could provide. Despite their attempts to get him to join the business, he stays away from the narcotics. But one day, a series of events places a packet of cocaine in his control, and when he quickly sells it for a profit, he realizes the potential this industry offers. But he must also be ready to deal with the repercussions.</p><h3><span id=Precious_2009>Precious (2009)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Precious.jpg alt width=889 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Precious,’ an Academy Award-winning picture based on Sapphire’s novel ‘Push,’ starring Gabourey Sidibe (‘Empire,’ American Horror Story), Mo’Nique, Paula Patton, and Oprah Winfrey. It tells the narrative of Precious, a teenage girl. Her home atmosphere has never been pleasant. She lives with her unemployed mother, who verbally and physically abuses her on a regular basis. Her father, who is no longer in their life, had also sexually abused her, from which she had already given birth to a child and is now pregnant once more. Precious’ daughter is cared for by her grandma while they live on welfare. With everything going on in her life, she takes advantage of the opportunity to attend a different school. Sidibe made her acting debut in this picture and was nominated for an Academy Award, while Geoffrey Fletcher became the first African-American to win an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p><h3><span id=Sorry_to_Bother_You_2018>Sorry to Bother You (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sorry-to-Bother-You.jpg alt width=1000 height=433 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Sorry to Bother You,’ one of the best and most imaginative films of last year, will stay with you for a long time. It’s not only filled of social messages, but it’s also a lot of fun to watch because of how they’re delivered. If you enjoy science fiction, you will enjoy this film because it is unique and unlike anything you have seen before. Lakeith Stanfield (‘Get Out,’ ‘Atlanta,’ ‘Someone Great’) plays Cassius Green, the protagonist. He works as a telemarketer and simply wants to escape his mundane existence. The CEO of a successful company offers him a job that does not appear to be demanding but pays well. Cassius accepts it without hesitation, because what could possibly go wrong?</p><h3><span id=Tyrel_2018>Tyrel (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Tyrel.jpg alt width=1024 height=693 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Jason Mitchell has acted in movies such as “Straight Outta Compton,” “Detroit,” and “Mudbound.” While these films, particularly the latter ones, used solemn tones and showcased his ability to depict serious people, ‘Tyrel’ gave him the chance to try something new. Mitchell plays the titular character in this lighthearted yet essential film. When you attend a social gathering or go to a new location, you feel more at ease when you see familiar faces. Finding someone of your own heritage can be really beneficial. Tyrel, on the other hand, lacks such benefit. He discovers he is the only black man in the cabin when he arrives for the weekend to attend a birthday party. After then, things start to become a little weird!</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub548258bd69d50827cd8b2e4669db15e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Tense Thrills Await: Kidnapping Movies on Hulu You Can't Miss</span></a><h3><span id=Undisputed_2002>Undisputed (2002)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Undisputed.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>George Chambers was widely regarded as the undisputed heavyweight champion. But when he is convicted of rape, everything he has worked for and fought for comes crashing down around him. He begins to gloat about his career to other detainees, still drunk on the pride of being a world champion. What he doesn’t realize is that the prison has its own kind of boxing, and what the boxers face outside is nothing compared to what they face inside. There are no rules, and losing could have disastrous consequences. When Chambers becomes a participant in a boxing match, he discovers this. ‘Undisputed,’ like many cult films, was critically panned upon its initial release. However, thanks to the services of the home video industry, its popularity gradually grew, leading to a sequel. If you enjoyed the first film, you will undoubtedly appreciate the sequel.</p><h3><span id=Where_Hands_Touch_2018>Where Hands Touch (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Where-Hands-Touch.jpg alt width=1334 height=667 sizes="(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Everyone knows how Hitler felt about Jews. They weren’t the only ones he thought were lacking. The only race he considered superior was his own, so the rest of the world was effectively his adversary. While Jews bore the brunt of his animosity, other ethnic groups in the country were also threatened. ‘Where Hands Touch’ tells the narrative of an adolescent girl who grows up in a Nazi-ruled country and discovers the horror of not belonging to the Aryan race. Leyna’s mother is German and her father is of African origin. Her boyfriend just joined Hitler Youth, and his father is a high-ranking Nazi. Leyna begins to be concerned about her own fate as the country becomes enveloped in the frightening plans laid out for Jews.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
