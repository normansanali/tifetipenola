But as time passed we became fascinated by our legends and one of them is our favorite multi-talented artist Danny Kaye.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block">The star has always been on gossip for his sexuality. After his separation from his wife and business partner Sylvia Fine in 1947, this question has arisen more than ever.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Another couple of Hollywood figures long linked as a gay couple were Danny Kaye and Laurence Olivier.

Freeman (@Freelineorlando) January 26, 2019</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block">A number of writers from that era had claimed that he was either bisexual or homosexual. Vivien Leigh’s biography even indicates that her marriage to Laurence Olivier ended because the great actor was having an affair with Kaye.&nbsp;</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block">Furthermore, it was claimed that he had a 10-year secret affair with Laurence Olivier&nbsp;but could not find evidence of his explicit romance</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block">So far nothing has been proven of Kaye’s gender hearsay unless he came out before the end.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=danny-kaye-married-life-and-partner-sylvia-finenbsp><span class=ez-toc-section id=danny-kaye-married-life-and-partner-sylvia-fine></span> Danny Kaye Married Life And Partner Sylvia Fine&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Danny Kaye and his former wife Sylvia Fine, married in Fort Lauderdale, on January 3, 1940.
