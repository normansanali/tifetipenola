It’s the TLC’s&nbsp;Match Me Abroad&nbsp;way we speak of. She is one of the six hopefuls/American singles traveling to Colombia, Morocco, and the Czech Republic for love or rejection in TLC’s newest matchmaking series.</p><p style=text-align:left>Let us tell you all about Stanika and if or not she can find and match energy to her first-ever boyfriend, in the rest of the writing.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Stanika Banks On TLC’s Match Me Abroad</strong></h3><p>In Match Me Abroad, Stanika Banks under matchmaker Nina Kharoufeh’s care moves to Morocco hoping to meet her first boyfriend.

He reached the age of 69 in June 2022. He loves God and his family. On his Facebook, he also mentioned attending Madison Ridgeland High School and Hinds Community College.
