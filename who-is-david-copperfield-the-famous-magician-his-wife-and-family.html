<time>22 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>David Copperfield is a world-renowned magician whose contributions to the entertainment industry have earned him living legend status as prescribed by the United States Library of Congress.</span></p><p><span>The master illusionist, who has yet to be named the Magician of the Century and King of Magic by the organization that governs magicians, is also the most successful of all time with gross earnings exceeding $4 billion.&nbsp;He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, eleven Guinness World Records and 21 Emmy Awards out of 38 nominations.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography, education and career</span></strong></h2><p><span>On September 16, 1956, in Metuchen, New Jersey, David Seth Kotkin, known today as David Copperfield, was welcomed into the world by his Jewish parents;&nbsp;Rebecca and Hyman Kotkin.&nbsp;His mother, Rebecca, born in Jerusalem, worked as an insurance adjuster while his father, Hyman, son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, ran a haberdashery.</span></p><p><span>Around the time he was 10, Copperfield, who had been described as shy and lonely, began performing magic tricks on his friends and around his home to fit in.&nbsp;Under the pseudonym “Davino the Boy Magician”, the young magician gained a kind of local fame that brought the attention of the Society of American Magicians.&nbsp;At the age of 12, the society admitted him into their organization, making him the youngest person to ever join the fraternity.</span></p><p><span>Copperfield attended Metuchen High School where he graduated in 1974. During this period, he notably taught a course in magic at New York University before enrolling at Fordham University, although he did not spend only about three weeks before packing up and moving to Chicago to take on the lead role.&nbsp;in the musical&nbsp;</span><span>The Magic Man</span><span>.&nbsp;It was around this time that Copperfield took on his current stage name, when he began starring in magic shows across the country, while performing in the musical, which became the longest-running in history. Chicago history.</span></p><p><span>In 1977, David Copperfield managed to present his first television show called The Magic of ABC, which exposed him to a wider audience.&nbsp;The following year he appeared in a CBS special called&nbsp;</span><span>The Magic of David Copperfield</span><span>&nbsp;after which he appeared in the film&nbsp;</span><span>Terror Train</span><span>&nbsp;(1980).&nbsp;Between 1978 and 2001, Copperfield made a total of 19 television specials and documentaries, including his most famous illusions such as the disappearance of an airplane, the disappearance and reappearance of the Statue of Liberty, him floating above the Grand Canyon, walking through the Great Wall of China, then escaping Alcatraz prison.</span></p><p><span>In the early 2000s, David Copperfield was performing more than 500 shows a year in different countries around the world.&nbsp;According to Forbes, the magician was earning millions of dollars at that time estimated to be around $55 million, placing him among the top ten biggest celebrity earners.&nbsp;As of 2018, all of this income put his net worth at $1 billion, making him the most commercially successful magician in history.</span></p><h2><strong><span>David Copperfield Family – wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>David Copperfield is unmarried but married to French model and designer, Chloé Gosselin.&nbsp;The pair reportedly started dating as far back as 2006, but chose to keep it a secret.&nbsp;In February 2010, they certified their relationship somewhat by welcoming a daughter, Sky, before getting engaged a few years later.&nbsp;It’s unclear if and when the two will get married, as Copperfield has previously opened up about her fear of getting married.&nbsp;This doesn’t seem to bother his future wife, as she said in an interview.&nbsp;The magician and she share a deep friendship as well as a child.&nbsp;It’s the most important commitment they could have with each other without getting married.</span></p><p><span>Gosselin born August 22, 1984 in Dreux, France now lives with his partner and daughter in the United States.&nbsp;She divides her time between their home in Las Vegas and New York and the Caribbean islands of Copperfield, known as Copperfield Bay.&nbsp;She is very active on social media through which she promotes the shoes she designs.</span></p><p class=postsid
