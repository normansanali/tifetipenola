It was supposed to be a destination hotel for international businessmen and social elites. Hanner spent $1 million on the 700-room Beaux Arts-style hotel, complete with a marble lobby, stained-glass windows, palm trees, and an opulent staircase.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222708 alt="The Lobby Of The Cecil Hotel" width=900 height=698 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/hotel-cecil-lobby.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222708 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Alejandro Jofré/Creative Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The marble lobby of the Cecil Hotel, which opened in 1927.</span></p><p>But Hanner would come to regret his investment. Just two years after the Cecil Hotel opened, the world was thrown into the Great Depression — and Los Angeles was not immune to the economic collapse. Soon enough, the area surrounding the Cecil Hotel would be dubbed “Skid Row” and become home to thousands of homeless people.</p><p>The once beautiful hotel soon gained a reputation as a meeting place for junkies, runaways, and criminals. Worse yet, the Cecil Hotel ultimately earned a reputation for violence and death.</p><h2>Suicide And Homicide At “The Most Haunted Hotel In Los Angeles”</h2><p>In the 1930s alone, the Cecil Hotel was home to at least six reported suicides. A few residents ingested poison, while others shot themselves, slit their own throats, or jumped out their bedroom windows.</p><p>In 1934, for example, Army Sergeant Louis D. Borden slashed his throat with a razor. Less than four years later, Roy Thompson of the Marine Corps jumped from atop the Cecil Hotel and was found on the skylight of a neighboring building.</p><p>The next few decades only saw more violent deaths.</p><p>In September 1944, 19-year-old Dorothy Jean Purcell awoke in the middle of the night with stomach pains while she was staying at the Cecil with Ben Levine, 38. She went to the bathroom so as not to disturb a sleeping Levine, and — to her complete shock — gave birth to a baby boy. She had no idea she had been pregnant.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222705 alt="Dorothy Jean Purcell" width=423 height=535 data-sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Dorothy-Jean-Purcell.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222705 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>A newspaper clip about Dorothy Jean Purcell, who threw her newborn baby out of her hotel bathroom window.</span></p><p>Mistakenly thinking her newborn was dead, Purcell threw her live baby out the window and onto the roof of the building next door. At her trial, she was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity and she was admitted to a hospital for psychiatric treatment.</p><p>In 1962, 65-year-old George Giannini was walking by the Cecil with his hands in his pockets when he was struck to death by a falling woman. Pauline Otton, 27, jumped from her ninth-floor window after an argument with her estranged husband, Dewey. Her fall killed both her and Giannini instantly.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314997 alt="Cecil Hotel In Los Angeles" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cecil-hotel-los-angeles.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314997 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Outside Los Angeles’ Cecil Hotel, host of numerous murders and suicides.</span></p><p>Police initially thought the two had committed suicide together but reconsidered when they found Giannini was still wearing shoes. If he had jumped, his shoes would have fallen off mid-flight.</p><p>In light of the suicides, mishaps, and murders, Angelinos promptly dubbed the Cecil “the most haunted hotel in Los Angeles.”</p><h2>A Serial Killer’s Paradise</h2><p>While tragic calamities and suicide have contributed heavily to the hotel’s body count, the Cecil Hotel has also served as a temporary home for some of the grisliest murderers in American history.</p><p>In the mid-1980s, <a href=#>Richard Ramirez</a> — murderer of 13 people and better known as the “Night Stalker” — lived in a room on the top floor of the hotel during much of his horrific killing spree.</p><p>After killing someone, he would throw his bloody clothes into the Cecil Hotel’s dumpster and saunter into the hotel lobby either completely naked or only in underwear — “none of which would have raised an eyebrow,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writes journalist Josh Dean</a>, “since the Cecil in the 1980s… ‘was total, unmitigated chaos.'”</p><p>At the time, Ramirez was able to stay there for a mere $14 per night. And with corpses of junkies reportedly often found in the alleys near the hotel and sometimes even in the hallways, Ramirez’s blood-soaked lifestyle surely raised nary an eyebrow at the Cecil.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-144068 alt="Night Stalker Mugshot" width=600 height=895 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/night-stalker-mugshot.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-144068 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Richard Ramirez was ultimately convicted of 13 counts of murder, five attempted murders, and 11 sexual assaults.</span></p><p>In 1991, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austrian serial killer Jack Unterweger</a> — who strangled prostitutes with their own bras — also called the hotel home. Rumor has it that he chose the hotel because of its connection to Ramirez.</p><p>Because the area around the Cecil Hotel was popular with prostitutes, Unterweger stalked these environs time and again in search of victims. One prostitute he is believed to have killed vanished right down the street from the hotel while Unterweger even claimed to have “dated” the hotel’s receptionist.</p><h2>Eerie Cold Cases At The Cecil Hotel</h2><p>And while some episodes of violence in and around the Cecil Hotel are attributable to known serial killers, some murders have remained unsolved.</p><p>To pick one of many, a local woman known around the area named Goldie Osgood was found dead in her ransacked room at the Cecil. She had been raped before suffering a fatal stabbing and beating. Though one suspect was found walking with bloodstained clothing nearby, he was later cleared and her killer was never convicted — another instance of disturbing violence at the Cecil that has gone unresolved.</p><p>Another grimly noteworthy guest of the hotel was Elizabeth Short, who came to be known as the “<a href=#>Black Dahlia</a>” after her 1947 murder in Los Angeles.</p><p>She reportedly stayed at the hotel just before her mutilation, which remains unsolved, despite a wealth of <a href=# rel=noopener>Black Dahlia suspects</a>, including an especially promising one named <a href=# rel=noopener>George Hodel</a>. What connection her death may have had to the Cecil is not known, but what is known is that she was found on a street not far away on the morning of January 15 with her mouth carved ear to ear and her body cut in two.</p><p>Such stories of violence are not simply a thing of the past. Decades after Short, one of the most mysterious deaths ever to take place at the Cecil Hotel happened as recently as 2013.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-210953 alt="Elisa Lam" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/elisa-lam.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-210953 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Elisa Lam</span></p><p>In 2013, Canadian college student <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elisa Lam</a> was found dead inside the water tank on the roof of the hotel three weeks after she had gone missing. Her naked corpse was found after hotel guests had complained of bad water pressure and a “funny taste” to the water. Though authorities ruled her death as an accidental drowning, critics believed otherwise.</p>Hotel surveillance footage of Elisa Lam before her disappearance.<p>Before her death, surveillance cameras caught Lam acting strangely in an elevator, at times appearing to yell at someone out of view, as well as apparently attempting to hide from someone while pressing multiple elevator buttons and waving her arms erratically.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="Elisa Lam Podcast" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img//thumb/300.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-disturbing-death-of-elisa-lam-cover.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> History Uncovered Podcast Episode 17: The Disturbing Death Of Elisa Lam When Elisa Lam was found inexplicably dead in February 2013, investigators were baffled — then the security footage taken just before she vanished only made things stranger.</a><p>After the video surfaced publicly, many people began to believe that the rumors of the hotel being haunted might be true. Horror aficionados began drawing parallels between the Black Dahlia murder and Lam’s disappearance, pointing out that both women were in their twenties, traveling alone from L.A. to San Diego, last seen at the Cecil Hotel, and were missing for several days before their bodies were found.</p><p>Thin though these connections may sound, the hotel has nevertheless developed a reputation for horror that defines its legacy to this day.</p><h2>The Cecil Hotel Today</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222711 alt="Stay On Main Hotel" width=600 height=903 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stay-on-main.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222711 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Jennifer Boyer/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>After a brief stint as the Stay On Main Hotel and Hostel, the hotel closed. It’s currently undergoing a $100 million renovation and being turned into $1,500-a-month “micro apartments.”</span></p><p>The last body was found at the Cecil Hotel in 2015 — a man who reportedly committed suicide — and ghost stories and rumors of the hotel’s haunting swirled once more. The hotel even subsequently served as the chilling inspiration for a season of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Horror Story</a> about a hotel that’s home to unimaginable murder and mayhem.</p><p>But in 2011, the Cecil attempted to shake off its macabre history by rebranding itself as the Stay On Main Hotel and Hostel, a $75-per-night budget hotel for tourists. Several years later, New York City developers signed a 99-year lease and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began gut-renovating</a> the building to include an upscale boutique hotel and hundreds of fully furnished micro-units in keeping with the surging co-living craze.</p><p>Perhaps with enough renovations, the Cecil Hotel can finally shake its reputation for all things bloody and eerie that has defined the ill-fated building for the better part of a century.</p><p>After this look at Los Angeles’ Cecil Hotel, check out <a href=#>Hotel del Salto, Colombia’s most haunted hotel</a>.
