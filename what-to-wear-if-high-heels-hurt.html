And, for those women who just can't stand wearing heels, numerous styles complement that LBD just like a five-inch heel would.</p><p>If high heels are just too painful for you,&nbsp;relax: there are options!&nbsp;And with so many options of styles and colors,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">you won't be breaking the bank to find the perfect pair of shoes</a> that will complement any outfit.</p><p>Check out these 10 awesome footwear options for women who aren't fans of wearing high heels, but still want to look cute.</p><h2 id=go-fancy-with-flats><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Go Fancy With Flats</span></h2><p>You don't have to have&nbsp;a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shoe warehouse like Celine Dion has for her massive collection of shoes</a>, but when it comes to flats, there are so many different options that you can't go wrong with buying a few pairs that will match just about anything. Wearing high heels for an entire night can be quite painful, so many women take a pair of flat shoes along with them, especially if they are going to a wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=high-quality-espadrilles-are-perfect-for-spring-and-summer><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>High-Quality Espadrilles Are Perfect For Spring And Summer</span></h2><p>Espadrilles are a great spring and summer shoe that looks great with a pair of light-wash jeans, skirts, and dresses. They are highly comfortable shoes and come in a variety of colors and styles. The sole of an espadrille show can be platform, wedge, or flat depending on the style you are looking for.</p><h2 id=lace-up-sandals-never-go-out-of-style><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lace-Up Sandals Never Go Out Of Style</span></h2><p>Lace-up sandals or gladiator sandals are trendy summer shoes that are a great alternative to high heels. Choose a neutral pair like black or beige, which go with pretty much anything, from high waisted shorts to loose dresses like the one above. They are chic flat shoes so they are very easy to walk in.</p><h2 id=flat-mules-look-more-polished><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Flat Mules Look More Polished</span></h2><p>Wearing a mule is a great option for the office because they look sophisticated and refined. A mule shoe has no back or constraint around the foot's heel, so they are a fantastic alternative to a heel during warmer weather. These shoes can be worn for any occasion and won't be going out of style anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=slide-sandals-are-stylish><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Slide Sandals Are Stylish</span></h2><p>Slide sandals have become a very popular alternative to wearing high heels, especially when going on vacation. Why would anyone want to wear uncomfortable and painful high heels while at a tropical destination that's meant to be a relaxing trip? Slide sandals are the perfect substitute to heels since they look good with flowy dresses you'll wear on a night out and while you're enjoying daytime activities.</p><h2 id=sneakers-and-dresses-are-now-a-trend><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sneakers And Dresses Are Now A Trend</span></h2><p>Wearing sneakers with dresses is a trend that'll last forever. Pair a&nbsp;casual summer dress with your favorite pair of Converses or Nike Air Force 1s to make your look a lot edgier. It is a trend that celebrities love and it isn't tricky to pull off. Find a sweater dress, an LBD, or a cute chambray mini dress and pair it with a pair of cute white sneakers!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kitten-heels-are-more-realistic-for-walking><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kitten Heels Are More Realistic For Walking</span></h2><p>If you want to wear heels but are worried about the pain that will come with them, opt to wear a shoe with a kitten heel. These heels are no longer associated with older women and have gained popularity because they are more realistic to wear if you have to do a lot of walking around. The kitten heel has transformed over the years and we've seen booties, mules, and sandals with this smaller heel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga's Most Questionable Fashion Choices (And Her Best)</a></span></p><h2 id=block-heels-are-sensible><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Block Heels Are Sensible</span></h2><p>Block heels are all the rage among women because of how comfortable they are. Block heels are a wider heeled shoe making them easier to walk around in and are a lot less painful than a typical high heel. These shoes offer more support and stability and are a terrific alternative to stilettos. Wear a pair of strappy open-toed block heels to a wedding or event and we bet you'll have them on all night.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Khloe Kardashian's Wardrobe Made Us Say "Huh?"</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-pointer-flat-gives-the-illusion-of-a-date-night-shoe><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>A Pointer Flat Gives The Illusion Of A Date Night Shoe</span></h2><p>A pointer flat will look a lot more elegant than a typical flat shoe, making them perfect for a dinner date.

These shoes are perfect&nbsp;for the summer and&nbsp;go great with white jeans, flirty dresses, and shorts. Wedges are more stable than heels and the thick wedge makes you feel like you are walking on level ground.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Gwen Stefani's Evolution In Fashion, In 15 Photos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGwedaemKtlmZt6qbXGoWShnZWhwG601KuraA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-to-wear-if-high-heels-hurt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-to-wear-if-high-heels-hurt.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-to-wear-if-high-heels-hurt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-to-wear-if-high-heels-hurt.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-to-wear-if-high-heels-hurt.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-to-wear-if-high-heels-hurt.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./justin-jackson-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./justin-jackson-net-worth.html>Justin Jackson Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./has-a-rookie-head-coach-ever-won-the-super-bowl.html>Has a rookie Head Coach ever won the Super Bowl?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./has-a-rookie-head-coach-ever-won-the-super-bowl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
