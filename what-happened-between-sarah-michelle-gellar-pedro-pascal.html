The flashback photo was actually a still from that episode in season 4. At that time, the 20-year-old actor was still credited for his character as Pedro Balmaceda. It came from his full name, José Pedro Balmaceda Pascal. This was long before his "daddy" days, as well as Gellar's "Mother" era, which she recently owned by using the title in her Instagram bio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Cruel Intentions actress has recently embraced her gay icon status after the resurgence of her cult classics. Thanks to longtime fans like the self-proclaimed Sarah Michelle Gellar historian, Evan Ross Katz who released a book called, Into Every Generation a Slayer Is Born: How Buffy Staked Our Hearts in 2022. Now a friend of Gellar's, the author actually came up with the idea of posting the Buffy throwback.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fqyjx5daqaajjoz.jpeg><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram carousel</a> posted in light of the viral photo, Katz shared a screenshot of his conversation with the actress. "Also I have an IG post idea for you," he texted, to which the <a href=#>Scooby-Do star</a> replied, "Go for it." The writer then pitched: "I think you should do a still from your scene with Pedro on BTVS," noting that "It's repeatedly gone viral on Twitter amid the Pedroaissance." Gellar agreed, saying, "Ok I will do man crush Monday."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katz captioned the post: "Never expected that my random text to SMG suggesting she post a throwback to her BUFFY scene with Pedro Pascal would spawn a whole news cycle.
