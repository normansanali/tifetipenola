So, Dara Yu, a contestant on Season 1 of MasterChef Junior ranked as the Runner Up at the time, took down the two adult men for the win.

Also, she thought she may be will be investing a good amount of her prize money. Maybe in some passion projects and possible future food businesses she shared. And then, she would maybe spend some of it on traveling.</p><p style=text-align:left>In the future, Dara would like to pursue teaching/educating, sharing her knowledge with other young, upcoming cooks, and, she said, for that may be she will turn to the TV or the internet.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Who Are Dara Yu’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>George Yu and Carole Yu are Dara Yu’s parents.</p><p style=text-align:left>Dara Yu’s dad, George Yu is no more.

Dara was 10 at the time Carole got married to Scott Stewart. Scott, like Carole, was Los Angeles based as of 2022 and he loved telling his story on YouTube.
