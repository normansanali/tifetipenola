The first two episodes of the Season 9 of Are You The One? dropped on Paramount+ on 18 January 2023 with a bunch of hot new cast, and Kamie Crawford as its host. So, as the TV’s once first-ever international dating show makes a huge return with 22 contestants from around the world, let us introduce to you Brooke Rachman, AKA Tini, one of its contestants.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Brooke Rachman On Are You The One?</strong></h3><p>Early in 2023, Brooke Rachman took to her social media to finally reveal why she had disappeared for a month a year before. She spilled that it was to live in a villa in Gran Canaria in Spain with 21 strangers to film the first-ever global season of Are You The One?. As to “why?” she said dating in Los Angeles had failed her miserably and she thought it was time for a drastic change.</p><p>That is why, she said, she decided to go on this dating show where she not just had a chance to find love but also win a million dollars. Saying this, she invited her people to follow her journey as she meet some pretty amazing singles from all over the world.</p><p>So, once the episodes were out, the season kickstarted with its first love triangle and it also involved Brooke. S09 E01 saw Brooke answer who she was attracted to out of the men. She points at Leo Svete because of his height, but she also tells that she liked Will Gagnon. The first episode further sees Brooke chat with Will and some deep chat with Leo. They relate to similar experiences with strict exes and their dad’s ICU stays. Brooke revealed her dad went to the ICU two weeks ago and Leo said that his dad too once almost died in the ICU.</p><p>As for Will, she ends up calling him “intense”. The next episode sees the two get into some arguments. Brooke says Will would be her number one if he was not mean. Will then promises he is not mean and even claims there is no one in the house that he is attracted to besides her. Brooke starts crying finding the gesture “really sweet.” They hug it out leaving room for maybe a romance in the future. But one could also not notice when the episode ended with Brooke sitting next to Leo in the first match-up ceremony.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Brooke Rachman Dating Status</strong></h3><p>Brooke Rachman’s relationship status was unclear at the time of this writing.
