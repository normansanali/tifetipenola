I’ve heard similar things said about me throughout my career, so it really didn’t affect me,” Lopez laughed at the cutting comments from the comedy actress.</p><p>In the following, we look at how Ayo Edebiri insulted Jennifer Lopez, forcing her to apologize to the singer. We also reveal how Ayo Edebiri dealt with the backlash of her Jennifer Lopez comments and how other comedians might learn from her mistake.</p><h2 id=ayo-adebiri-39-s-harsh-comments-on-jennifer-lopez-39-s-career>Ayo Adebiri's Harsh Comments On Jennifer Lopez's Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jlo-and-ayo-edebiri-snl.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ayo Edebiri made the controversial comments about Jennifer Lopez during an appearance on the February 2020 episode of Laci Mosley's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scam Goddess</a> podcast.

She thinks she's on multiple tracks, but it's not her. I think she thinks that she's still good even though, like, she's not singing for most of these songs."</p><p>"A lot of the write-ups of the songs will be like, 'J.Lo didn't have time to make it to the studio,' like, J.Lo was busy," she added.
