With a career spanning over seven decades, it’s no wonder the Texas native has a legion of fans. He became a household name with hits like &nbsp;“On the Road Again,” “To All the Girls I’ve Loved Before” and “Pancho and Lefty.” Along with his award-winning music career, Willie is also widely recognized for his activism, including fighting for farmers’ rights, the legalization of marijuana and advocating for the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>His love life is quite as legendary as well! The Grammy winner has walked down the aisle a total of four times with four different women: <strong>Martha Matthews, Shirley Collie, Connie Koepke </strong>and <strong>Annie D’Angelo</strong>. “I’m not easy to live with,” he admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parade </a>in 2010 as a reason for his multiple nuptials. “I’m pretty temperamental, you know. I’ve been used to doing things my own way for so long that I’m not interested in any suggestions.” Now that Paramount+ has released Willie Nelson & Family in 2023, learn more about Willie’s ex-wives and his current wife, Annie!</p><h2>Martha Matthews</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>When Willie was 19 years old and discharged from the Air Force due to back injuries, he met Martha, who was 16 at the time, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sunset Blvd Records</a>. They would go on to welcome three children: <strong>Lana, Susie, </strong>and <strong>Willie Nelson Jr. </strong>But their home was not a happy one, as the young couple “quarreled, brawled, and drank heavily,” per Parade. The relationship became so volatile, Martha once tied up Willie in a blanket and beat him with a broomstick, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Los Angeles Times</a>. Martha denied the story, saying she used a kid’s jump rope instead of a blanket to tie Willie up. They would split in 1962.</p><h2>Shirley Collie</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 1963, Willie took Shirley for his second bride. Shirley had a successful career as a rockabilly singer, yodeler, guitarist and songwriter. The couple would even often tour together. However, divorce was imminent after Shirley found a bill from the maternity ward of a Houston hospital saying Willie had fathered a baby with another woman, Connie Koepke. “The bill said the charges were for the birth of a baby girl, Paula Carlene, born to a Mrs. Connie Nelson,” Willie recalled in his memoir 2020 “Me and Sister Bobbie: True Tales of the Family Band,” via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “Shirley wanted to know who in the hell was Connie Nelson. Couldn’t lie. Was caught flatfooted. Had to get the words out of my mouth. ‘Connie’s my girlfriend and Paula’s our daughter.'” Willie and Shirley went their separate ways in 1971.</p><h2>Connie Koepke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Willie-Nelsons-Wives-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the same year he divorced Shirley, Willie made an honest woman out of Connie. Two years later, they welcomed another daughter named Amy. Their 16-year marriage would bring Willie back to his home state of Texas, where he felt he was could connect with his fans again. &nbsp;“I really felt like I needed to be in Texas playing to the people that were and still are my base,” he told Parade. The love affair wouldn’t survive Willie’s affairs, though, and they bid adieu in 1988. “I messed up another marriage. My wandering ways were too much for any woman to put up with,” he admitted in his memoir.</p><h2>Annie D’Angelo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Willie-Nelsons-Wives-embed1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>While working on the film Stagecoach in 1986, Willie met makeup artist Annie. “In the mideighties I fell head over heels in love with Ann Marie D’Angelo, called Annie. Never had met a woman like her before,” he admitted in his memoir. Willie and Annie would go on to wed in 1991. “There was friction with my other wives. But it seems like Annie and I did OK with each other. It takes a special person to live with me,” he told Parade. The couple are still together after 30 years and going strong!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9aio6WhlWK7prjSqKVmr5mrsrR5k29nbnFha3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwillie-nelson-wives-4605916.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwillie-nelson-wives-4605916.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwillie-nelson-wives-4605916.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwillie-nelson-wives-4605916.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwillie-nelson-wives-4605916.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwillie-nelson-wives-4605916.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./native-american-women.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./native-american-women.html>Meet 9 Native American Women Who Changed History Forever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./karrueche-tran-goes-braless-in-tiny-white-mesh-top-and-slacks-as-she-leaves-coachellas-first-day.html>Karrueche Tran goes braless in tiny, white mesh top and slacks as she leaves Coachella's first day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./karrueche-tran-goes-braless-in-tiny-white-mesh-top-and-slacks-as-she-leaves-coachellas-first-day.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
