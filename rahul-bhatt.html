Rahul’s father, Bittaje Bhat, cried a lot in front of the camera while answering questions about his son. Apart from this, Rahul lived with his mother and one younger sister prior to his marriage.</p><p>His mother’s name is not revealed in the media, but there are videos in which anyone can feel Rahul’s mother’s grief. In terms of religion, Rahul Bhatt (Kashmiri Pandit) was both a Hindu and a Kashmiri Pandit. In his life, he practiced Hinduism.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Following Rahul’s death, it was revealed in the media that he worked as a Revenue Officer in the Budgam district. On May 12, 2022, he was killed by his officer. Terrorists approached his office, asked for his name, and then shot him with their guns. The media has raised the question of how terrorists learned Rahul’s name. Previously, Rahul’s wife Meenakshi Bhatt stated in an interview that Rahul felt insecure as a Chadoora Tehsildar officer in Budgam.</p><p>She revealed that Rahul had also requested that the local administration relocate him to headquarters for the next two years. She revealed that her husband had suspicions about some people in his office plotting to kill Rahul and join forces with the terrorists. Rahul’s wife has accused her husband’s office employees of being involved in Rahul’s murder. Meenakshi also revealed that she spoke with her husband on the phone just 10 minutes before his death on May 12, 2022.</p><h2>Rahul Bhatt’s Wife, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Rahul Bhatt</strong> was both married and a father. For the past 10-11 years, he has been married to Meenakshi Bhatt. Rahul was the father of a lovely little girl. His daughter’s name is still being researched and will be updated soon. Following his death, the government declared that one of Rahul Bhatt’s family members will be given a job. We anticipate that his wife, Meenakshi, will be appointed to a government position soon. It will assist her in covering all of her daughter’s expenses.</p><h2>Rahul Bhatt’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Rahul Bhatt</strong> was working as a government official under a special program designed to employ migrant Kashmiri Pandits. His salary was not particularly high, but he easily covered all of his family’s expenses. Rahul was content with his small family’s life.
