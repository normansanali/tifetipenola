Both are linear in nature. As a result of Br’s stronger electronegativity than that of H, Br2 is considered a nonpolar molecule, whereas HBr is considered a polar molecule.
Is HBr a polar molecule, and if so, how does it behave? The link formed by HBr is a polar covalent bond. Take note of the fact that the electrons spend more time on the atom Br.

Answer
An extension cord should not be used unless absolutely necessary. You should use an extension cable only if you absolutely have to. Make sure it is grounded (the sort with three prongs), less than six feet in length, and at least as thick as the treadmill power cord before using it (14 gauge).
