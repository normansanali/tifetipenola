<time>27 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2>Final Words</h2><p>The OnePlus 3 was certainly the best Android phone at the $400 price point, and it arguably had the best value for your money of any smartphone in general. The OnePlus 3T is a successor to the OnePlus 3, being better in some ways and equally good in all others. Normally that would make it a natural replacement for the OnePlus 3, and OnePlus seems to think so as they've discontinued the OnePlus 3 and replaced it with the 3T. However, these upgrades do not come for free, and the price of the phone has increased by a significant amount to accommodate the upgrades.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10836/DSC021882_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>For the components that are shared between the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T, the experience and level of quality provided are equivalent between the two. The build quality is just as good, with the only change being the removal of the silver color and the introduction of gunmetal grey and gold finishes in its place. The display is essentially the same, although in my case I did see an even higher level of accuracy in the sRGB mode than I did on the OnePlus 3T, but it's impossible to say whether this is true of all units or if mine was just exceptionally good. The rear-facing camera quality is unchanged, although OnePlus advertises improved EIS during video recording. This is something that could easily be brought to the OnePlus 3 in a software update, so I'm unsure if it's really something that can be considered an advantage of the 3T. I also feel that the poor video quality on Snapdragon 820 devices means that it's not even worth discussing which ones have slightly better video quality than others.</p><p>The three aspects that have changed are the battery, the SoC, and the front-facing camera. For the battery the improvement is fairly obvious, with the 13% increase in capacity essentially giving you a corresponding 13% increase in battery life. Moving the SoC from MSM8996 to MSM8996 Pro makes the phone roughly 10% faster for CPU-bound tasks and 5% faster for GPU-bound tasks. These are fairly modest improvements, but it's important to also note that this is a high level perspective that doesn't take into account improvements in efficiency and fixes for errata that have been bundled into Snapdragon 821. Finally, you have the new front-facing camera which moves from an 8MP Sony sensor with 1.4µm pixels to a 16MP Samsung sensor with 1.0µm pixels.</p><p>With all these upgrades comes an increase in price from $399 to $439 in the United States, with corresponding increases in other currencies. $40 doesn't sound like an enormous amount of money on its own, but when a phone is initially priced at $399 it represents a price increase of 10%, which is not insignificant. The question is whether the improvements made in the OnePlus 3T are worth this 10% increase in price. This really comes down to the user and what they value in a device. For example, I didn't really touch on the front-facing camera because I think increasing the price of a phone to inflate the pixel count on the front-camera is not a good decision. I find myself asking how much cheaper the phone would be if it had retained the perfectly adequate 8MP camera from the OnePlus 3. The same is true for the SoC; Snapdragon 821 doesn't provide enough of an improvement in performance to justify increasing the price of the phone. The only change that actually does impact the user in a visible and meaningful way is the improved battery life.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10836/DSC022002_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>All of that being said, I don't think the OnePlus 3T provides a poor value for the money. What's really in question here is whether the OnePlus 3 provided better value for its price. As I've used the phone and thought about the price I've been leaning toward that conclusion, as neither the SoC change nor the new front camera have meaningfully improved my experience, and the 13% larger battery is not worth $40 on its own. If you truly value having the best SoC and having more pixels in your selfies then the improvements may be worth a 10% increase in price for you, but for me I think it just pushes the price closer to the realm of flagship devices without much to show for it.</p><p>Ultimately, I still believe that the OnePlus 3T is a very good phone for the price, and it is a better phone than the OnePlus 3. However,&nbsp;if you were to offer me the OnePlus 3 and 3T at their original prices, I think I would just opt to get the OnePlus 3. I would definitely miss the longer battery life, but for me personally, the other changes don't add up to enough to justify the increase in price.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5xhJJvZq2glWK8r7HPpaysZWOpeq61zaJkq52mnrK4e5Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-oneplus-3t-mini-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-oneplus-3t-mini-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-oneplus-3t-mini-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-oneplus-3t-mini-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-oneplus-3t-mini-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-oneplus-3t-mini-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./grant-knipp-video-shoutout.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./grant-knipp-video-shoutout.html>Grant Knipp - Video Shoutout</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./double-hit-move.html>Double Hit (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./double-hit-move.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
