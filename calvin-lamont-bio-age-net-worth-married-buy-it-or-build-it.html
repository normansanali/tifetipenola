The series stars Dallas-based twin brothers and contractors <a href=#>Chris</a> and Calvin LaMont as they engage in a little friendly competition to help clients figure out if they should renovate an existing home or build a new one to fit their needs.</p><p>Now, in the rest of the writing, we shall tell you all about one of the twins Calvin LaMont, his age, net worth,&nbsp;Buy It Or Build It&nbsp;stint, and everything.</p><h3><strong>Calvin LaMont On HGTV’s Buy It Or Build It</strong></h3><p>HGTV’s&nbsp;Buy It Or Build It&nbsp;features Calvin LaMont and his brother trying to help clients find their dream homes either by buying and renovating an existing home or starting from scratch by building a new one.</p><p>During each hour-long episode, of the six-part series, Calvin likes the clean slate and lack of boundaries and therefore prefers building from the ground up.
