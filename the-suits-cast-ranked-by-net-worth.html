The bulk of the stars that make up the series were already quite known before the show began airing. Moreover, even the relatively unknown actors quickly became household names. This has led to some pretty comfortable net worths.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=626 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>For a whopping nine seasons, <a href=#>Suits was one of the most-watched legal dramas of all time</a>. The witty and brilliantly written series focused on the lives of the intelligent lawyers that make up the Pearson Hardman firm. Centered around the two leads, Harvey Specter and Mike Ross, Suits covers a wide range scandalous lawsuits, personal drama, and office politics. Furthermore, while it has a hoard of serious moments, the series shines best when it ventures into mild comedy. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the actors have all said goodbye to their roles</a> for good, they’re all still swimming in some level of financial security (via <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=h-amanda-schull-katrina-bennett data-injectable=false>Amanda Schull (Katrina Bennett)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>Amanda Schull was a very interesting addition to the Suits cast. Her character, Katrina Bennett was introduced as a driven associate whose loyalties were often questioned by the viewers. Her recurring role lasted from seasons two till seven, before she was upgraded to the main cast. Outside of acting, Schull had already made a name for herself as a stellar ballerina. She danced with San Francisco Ballet from 1999 until 2006. Today, she boasts a comfy net worth between $1 and $5 million.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Rick Hoffman (Louis Litt)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=882 data-injectable=true>Portrayed by Rick Hoffman, Louis Litt is the typical character who fans seem to have a love-hate relationship with. Louis is a brilliant but socially awkward attorney driven by his desire for approval. Hoffman beautifully captured the nuances of Louis’ humorous and emotional journey, from being a hilariously self-absorbed antagonist to a character who earns our sympathy and affection. Hoffman’s net worth is estimated to be about $3 million. Although he is a talented actor, he does not have as extensive a portfolio of high-earning projects compared to some of his co-stars.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sarah Rafferty (Donna Paulsen)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=849 data-injectable=true>Sarah Rafferty injected sharp wit, humor, and charisma into the character of Donna Paulsen.

Harvey is a top-tier lawyer with an expensive taste in suits, a razor-sharp mind, and an unwavering loyalty to his colleagues. Macht’s chemistry with the other cast members is one of the show’s defining features. His portrayal of Harvey is a testament to his acting prowess which made him one of the standout stars of the show.

She may have only been on the show for two seasons, but seasoned veteran Katherine Heigl’s net worth is no joke. The Grey’s Anatomy and rom-com alum starred as the brilliant attorney Samantha Wheeler. Heigl made her mark in the series, and she brought her signature charm to the role. However, she’s been in the game long before Suits, and boasts a delicious net worth of $30 million. Even Wheeler would be proud!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Meghan Markle (Rachel Zane)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=false>Before becoming the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle was widely known for her role as Rachel Zane on Suits.
