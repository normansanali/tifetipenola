The following year, she signed on to star as Sadie Campbell in the TV series The O.C for six episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liberty Ross’ Life After The Rupert Sanders And Kristen Stewart Cheating Scandal</a></span></p><p>And while she continued to land parts on shows and movies in the following years, it wasn’t until 2008 when Reed had landed her biggest role to date - getting to play Rosalie in Twilight, of course.</p><p>The first installment was an enormous success, bringing in a whopping $407 million at the box office with a $37 million budget.</p><p>The film’s production company Summit Entertainment knew they had a hit franchise on their hands, with the second installment, New Moon, crushing its predecessor with a total of $709 million earned at the box office while the third part, Eclipse, pulled in another $698 million.</p><p>It’s believed that Reed was earning between $750,000-$1 million per film but before signing on for Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2, the actress, along with her co-stars Ashley Greene and Kellan Lutz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">formed a united front in the hopes of receiving a pay rise</a> to $4 million respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Entertainment Weekly, however, Reed quickly realized she wasn’t going to get the salary increase and therefore settled with the same amount she made before renegotiating her contract.</p><p>“Greene and Lutz had initially banded together with fellow co-stars Nikki Reed and Jackson Rathbone to form a united front, but sources say Reed backed down and is now close to finalizing her deal, which is said to be in the $750,000-$1 million range per film,” the publication wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Kristen Stewart Regret Starting A Relationship With Her Ex Robert Pattinson?</a></span></p><p>In contrast to Stewart’s salary, who earned $12.5 million each for the final two installments, her co-stars were fighting tooth and nail to pull in less than ten percent of that amount, which sounds absurd but given that Reed, in particular, didn’t have a big role in the franchise, she still earned a reasonable sum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Breaking Dawn: Part 2 was released in 2012, Reed wasted no time to book other roles, such as Lizzete in Empire State and Amanda in the 2013 mystery Pawn.</p><p>Most of her movies since Twilight have been low-budget productions, so it’s fair to assume that she probably won’t be earning as much as she did earlier in her career, but that’s not to say that her latest projects haven’t helped push her net worth to pass $12 million.</p><p>In 2015, Reed landed a recurring role on the FOX TV series Sleepy Hollow, playing Betsy Ross for a whopping 18 episodes. No word on how much she was paid for her involvement, but considering the show had already entered its third series at the time - proving to be a ratings hit - Reed would have made a substantial amount.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Kristen Stewart’s Employees Have Said About Working For Her</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most recently, she starred in the Hulu series Dollface and Netflix’s V-Wars, which just so happens to co-star her husband Ian Somerhalder.</p><p>We should probably also throw in that the floral-shaped engagement ring Somerhalder presented his wife in 2015, which&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly cost the actor up to $200,000</a>, according to Hollywood Life.</p><p>In 2017, she launched Bayou With Love, selling items made from recycled gold and diamonds which have been sourced from a carbon-neutral producer.</p><p>Speaking about her business and why she thinks it’s had such success with her fans, Reed told The Zoe Report: "We like to encourage our customers to purchase grown diamonds."</p><p>"They're not cubic zirconium or fake diamonds. They're actually molecularly identical to diamonds, they just don't have to be mined for because the vendor we source from has the technology to grow them with solar energy in California.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristen Stewart’s Girlfriend Gives An Insight Into Their Relationship, Will They Finally Tie The Knot?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmq7ChnJ60qcCMrKuaql2jtqy3yGapnp2UYq6urdKsnJ1lmJq%2Fbn2RZqSipJyevK95zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-how-twilight-star-nikki-reed-amassed-her-12-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-how-twilight-star-nikki-reed-amassed-her-12-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-how-twilight-star-nikki-reed-amassed-her-12-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-how-twilight-star-nikki-reed-amassed-her-12-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-how-twilight-star-nikki-reed-amassed-her-12-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-twilight-star-nikki-reed-amassed-her-12-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-big-of-a-trailer-can-an-suv-tow.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-big-of-a-trailer-can-an-suv-tow.html>How big of a trailer can an SUV tow?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emmily-elizabeth-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-203672-html.html>Emmily Elizabeth Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emmily-elizabeth-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-203672-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
