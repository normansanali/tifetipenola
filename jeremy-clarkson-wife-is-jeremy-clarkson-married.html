At A level, he famously left with one C and two U (fail) grades.</p><p>Clarkson attended Repton with former Top Gear Executive Producer Andy Wilman and Formula One engineer Adrian Newey.</p><p>He was cast as Atkinson, a prep school student, in a BBC radio Children’s Hour serial adaptation of Anthony Buckeridge’s Jennings novels until his voice broke.</p><p>Clarkson’s first job was as a traveling salesman for his parents’ Paddington Bear toy company. Later, he worked as a journalist for the Rotherham Advertiser before moving on to the Rochdale Observer, Wolverhampton Express and Star, Lincolnshire Life, Shropshire Star, and Associated Kent Newspapers.</p><p>In his final column for Top Gear magazine in 2015, he credited the Shropshire Star as his first outlet as a motoring columnist.</p><p>Clarkson founded the Motoring Press Agency (MPA) in 1984, where he conducted road tests for local newspapers and automotive magazines alongside fellow motoring journalist Jonathan Gill. This grew into articles for publications like Performance Car. He has been a regular contributor to Top Gear magazine since its inception in 1993.</p><p>Clarkson wrote for Amstrad Computer User in 1987, compiling Amstrad CPC game reviews.</p><p>Clarkson contributes to the tabloid newspaper The Sun and the broadsheet newspaper The Sunday Times on a regular basis. His Times columns are reprinted in The Weekend Australian newspaper.</p><p>He also contributes to the Toronto Star’s “Wheels” section. He has written a number of humorous books about cars and other topics, with many of his books being collections of articles he wrote for The Sunday Times.</p><p>Clarkson’s first major television role was as a presenter on the British motoring show Top Gear from October 27, 1988, to March 3, 1999, in the show’s previous format.</p><p>From 20 October 2002 to 8 March 2015, Clarkson also presented the show’s new format. He and co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond are credited with making Top Gear the most-watched TV show on BBC Two, which is rebroadcast in over 100 countries.</p><p>Prior to a restructuring that gave BBC Worldwide full control of the Top Gear rights, Clarkson’s company Bedder 6, which handled merchandise and international distribution for Top Gear, earned more than £149 million in revenue in 2012.</p><p>Between 2005 and 2010, Clarkson was embroiled in a protracted legal battle over access to a “permissive path” across the grounds of his second home, a converted lighthouse on the Isle of Man, following reports that dogs had attacked and killed sheep on the property.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jeremy Clarkson Wife: Is Jeremy Clarkson Married?</h2><p>Currently, Jeremy Clarkson is not married, however, he has been married twice.</p><p>Clarkson married Alex Hall in 1989, but after six months she left him for one of his friends. In Fulham, in May 1993, he married his manager, Frances Cain, daughter of VC recipient Robert Henry Cain.</p><p>The couple and their three children lived in Chipping Norton, Cotswolds. Clarkson has been described as a Chipping Norton set member.</p><p>Clarkson’s second wife, who is known for buying him car-related gifts, gave him a Mercedes-Benz 600 for Christmas in 2007. In&nbsp;2014, Clarkson and Cain divorced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOcq52drnqkuMCroqynnmLEqrLEZqCsZZqav6a52GaapZmioMCwuoymmKuqmZqxcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeremy-clarkson-wife-is-jeremy-clarkson-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeremy-clarkson-wife-is-jeremy-clarkson-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeremy-clarkson-wife-is-jeremy-clarkson-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeremy-clarkson-wife-is-jeremy-clarkson-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeremy-clarkson-wife-is-jeremy-clarkson-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeremy-clarkson-wife-is-jeremy-clarkson-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./katy-perrys-trick-to-eating-what-she-wants-and-staying-thin-201291.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./katy-perrys-trick-to-eating-what-she-wants-and-staying-thin-201291.html>Katy Perry's Trick to Eating What She Wants and Staying Thin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-does-rod-wave-weigh.html>How Much Does Rod Wave Weigh?
