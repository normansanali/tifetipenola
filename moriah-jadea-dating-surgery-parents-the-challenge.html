Is she dating anyone? Is she still with Johnny Bananas? What is her ethnicity? Who are her parents?</p><p>Read all about her in this article below.</p><h3><strong>The Challenge: Is Moriah Jadea Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Moriah Jadea was single at the time of this article in October 2023, according to her Facebook.</p><p>When Moriah appeared on season 38 of The Challenge, she had a showmance with Johnny Bananas. While they shared sparks with each other, not many viewers were sure that Moriah was ready to settle down with Johnny.</p><p>One viewer wrote on Reddit, “Bananas is like that cool, fun uncle that comes around during the holidays. You know the one that gives you a noogie and says “Wow you got so big” and then heads to get a drink. Bananas will forever have girlfriends. I don’t know if he’ll ever have a wife because he’s not ready. He cheats on almost all of his girlfriends.”</p><p>Others too perceived Johnny as someone who would have girlfriends but wouldn’t settle down with one.</p><p>During The Official Challenge Podcast: Ride or Dies Reunion: Part 1 Moriah hinted that something went down between the two and their relationship was done. Devyn inquires of Tori, Aneesa, and Da’Vonne about the future of Bananas and Moriah. Da’Vonne then informs that Moriah announced her single status on Instagram.</p><p>Tori says “…if they are in a relationship, they’re going to be playing it very quiet because Johnny obviously doesn’t want to… and I think he’s kind of like felt the heat from that, and he’s like ‘let’s lay low’, and I think the last time we talked to her, three weeks ago–she was in love, so…”</p><p>Additionally, Moriah confirmed the breakup during a Q&A. In one caption, she claimed her life improved after she started trusting God instead of getting upset “when things don’t go my way anymore.” She posted another caption answering the follower, “Yes, but no bad blood with anyone.”</p><p>On MTV’s Official Challenge Podcast, Moriah confessed that Johnny “Bananas” isn’t her typical type because of his age and height. When the game began, she recalled him attempting to kiss her in the kitchen but claiming she refused, leading others to believe she was playing him. Moriah, on the other hand, explained that she declined the approach because she didn’t know him well enough yet.</p><p>The last time they were likely together was after the end of the previous season when Moriah visited Johnny in LA. Although they didn’t appear together, Johnny posted a pic of feeding squirrels in his yard on IG and she posted a story feeding squirrels in his yard.</p><p>Born on 22 June 1982, Johnny Bananas turned 41 years old in 2023. He is the champion of The Island, The Ruins, Rivals, Battle of the Exes, Free Agents, Rivals III, Champs vs. Stars 1, and Total Madness, and was a finalist on The Inferno 3, Rivals II, Ride or Dies, and The Challenge: USA 2.</p><p>Johnny also competed in The Duel, The Gauntlet III, Cutthroat, Battle of the Exes II, Battle of the Bloodlines, Invasion of the Champions, Champs vs. Pros, Dirty 30, Vendettas, Final Reckoning, War of the Worlds, War of the Worlds 2, and World Championship.</p><p>Moriah also had a fling with The Challenge: Ride or Dies veteran Fessy Shafaat. They originally worked well together, culminating in a critical Challenge victory, but were broken up when they were divided into teams.</p><p>Moriah appeared on the Challenge Mania podcast following her exit, discussing her biggest regret from the season. When asked about her present working relationship with Fessy, the rookie stated she wished she had given more “honest” responses in her confessional.</p><h4><strong>Moriah Jadea Surgery</strong></h4><p>From season 38 to 39, Moriah Jadea appeared a little different because she had a nose job at the start of 2023. She took to Twitter to address the plastic surgery rumors after followers commented on her new nose.</p><p>Moriah&nbsp;said: “I’ve seen some comments regarding my nose job since the reunion posts. Guys, I wasn’t even barely 3 months post-op. The healing time is one year. You should have seen me the first month.”</p><p>The Challenge star was previously slated for surgery when she appeared on the show. She gave updates on the treatment on her Instagram Story at the time, but fans are concerned about her nose.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Moriah Jadea?</strong></h3><p>Born in April 1996, Moriah Jadea turned 27 years old in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Moriah Jadea Parents?</strong></h3><p>Moriah Jadea is proud of her Polish and Puerto Rican ethnicity.
